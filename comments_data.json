I sign up here deposit the money and start with the action in no time and generally when I join and send the money to casino cashier it takes 10-15 minutes but here it was smooth and fast. I like fast. They were established more than 10 years ago. And are a good name in the 'gaming club'. They are owned by the digi media company and they have the best casinos and are very trusted.I deposited 40 from my skrill and got straight to the action with the games i started with the Avalon slot and got nothing here and left this game with a loss and only got a couple of small combinations. And nothing else. This game generally gives a lot of action and it just about time and I was just unlucky.After this I played break da bank and this is a very promising slot and here I won around 30$. I really loved this game and this is one of the best from the Mg software. After this I was in the table games and roulette got me red every single time I bet on red and I never had so much fun playing roulette before and i just loved this game.I took out 150 from this casino and played again with the money I left but I lost that but I loved this casino a lot and usually I do not really reach till 150 and the return to the players here is just amazing.Fast support good return to the players and fast games and no sick variance I think this casino is the right place for me and every body else too. I keep playing here and a regular member now. I think this casino is a 9.5 for me .",

          "comment": "I think The gambling club casino room is probably the oldest casino room and it has been established since the early 90's and is undoubtedly one of the biggest online casino rooms in the world. The fact that it is still going good after almost more than 20 years says is enough for a user to understand that this is the right place to deposit your money. The registration process is a bit long to be real honest but they have to verify he users before they let anyone play on their room so I cut them some slack on this one because I have seen a lot of casino rooms which take ages. They have probably the best bonus offers for the new users to benefit from including the weekend bonus offer which is something that not everyone has to offer. The support team is very polite, patient and responsive and sometimes I start troubling he support team for almost nothing because I love the way they are so attentive and how they make us feel so important.I made a deposit of 100 dollars and as promised I got a 100% match up bonus no questions asked. It belongs to belle rock entertainment which is honestly not a very reputed group when I comes to the name game. But still gambling club has managed to stay one of the best. I love slots and playing poker with his casino room and I have not won a lot of money but still I love playing with them because the games are very nice and I have mad e a lot of friends here so we're all home. They offer a lot of free spins which is the coolest thing about slots. I love free spins. I have switched to another casino room but not because this is not a casino room but only because the room I am playing with now is owned by my friend.",

          "comment": "About 2 weeks ago I became a member at Gaming Club casino. I did it for 2 reasons- I saw a promotion of 5 free spins on sign up and second- they have Microgaming software, which is one of my favorites.  The bonus I saw was part of their welcome offer. On sign up you would get 5 free spins, on first deposit 15 and on second- 30 spins, all on Avalon.First I downloaded their software, signed up and when I didn't see any free spins in my account, I contacted live support. Support was really nice, but unfortunately I was told that my region wasn't available for this offer. To make up for this, support offered to add some free spins on my deposit of at least 20\u20ac. Then I asked about the overall minimum deposit and she told me it was only 1\u20ac. So I guess Gaming Club one of the rare casinos that have 1\u20ac minimum deposit, which is nice just because of the fact that I don't like limits. I made a 15\u20ac deposit via neteller because I just wanted to have some fun. I know its not much, but if you're lucky, it is enough. This time I played only table games- black jack, but with 1\u20ac bets I lost very quickly.I wanted to spend a little more time there so I went to their tournament section. I have to admit, I played all free rolls they had, starting with Hitman, Agent Jane Blonde, Tomb Rider and even Thunderstruck II. I had much fun with Thunderstruck II because it was a 30 minute free roll with 100000 coins and I had some decent wins, so after this I will definitely pay a visit to this game with my real money balance.So far I think Gaming Club is a good, trustable and recommendable casino as they have been in the business for more than 20 years and I will definitely play there again. The game selection is super wide, support works 24/7 and is supportive and professional. I have nothing bad to say so 9/10!",

They kept saying it was 50x the bonus amount but there was no way to verify it anywhere. I had to ask support to tell me the wager left. After a few years one day i just did a 10$+7.50$ deposit and i gambled a few hundreds then i asked support what was my wager left. I should have started with 7.5x50=375$. Support told me i had something like 437$ left to wager. I told them it was impossible and fought 1h on chat but they would always escape the question. Then i calculated and realized that from the beginning they were putting 70x wager on the bonuses and NOT 50x. Pure scam. Now i know why there is no way to look at our wager left by ourselves. Never returned.",

Then email after email, calling them up they finally paid me some to neteller and the rest to bank a bit after. Disgusting, when i deposit it goes in instantly but to withdraw out of the casino is 100 times harder then to deposit. pathetic\nI have deposited $85,000 in this casino group too in the last month and a half.\nso i asked for a match bonus of 100% they agreed if i deposited $900 they would 100% match it, i was in live chat and they were waiting on the deposit, my bank was doing maintenance at the time so there was restrictions on my card to make a deposit i come back later on (1 hour) to make the deposit and got this \nhere is a little conversation i had recently with them, they threatened me in this chat as you can clearly see because i said id post this up",

The last time I deposit 30\u20ac and went straight to the Casino Holdem table, because it is my favorite casino game. I placed 1\u20ac bets and won for 6 times in a row, in one of them I had straight combination and I increased my balance to 53\u20ac.I hadn't played baccarat for a while, so I went to baccarat table. I don't know why I play this game at all, because I almost always lose! This wasn't an exception, so after 5 unlucky guesses I quit this game. I played black jack as well, I was lucky and after spending some time there had increased my balance to 80 euros. This was the first time I played with live Asian dealers, it was very cool. I find it very interesting.I am not a big fan of Playtech slots but I checked out a few of them. I played Iron man 2, which I've already played in a few other casinos, Highway Kings and Captains Treasures. Overall the slots gave me only loss and I decided to withdraw.I was a little disappointed that the variety of slots is kind of small.Overall, I think this is a very good casino and you can trust it with your money, the withdrawal was super fast- I got my money to my Skrill account in 5 hours. ButI've noticed that playtech is more focused on live games, which for me is a plus, sowhen I'll want to play good table games and live dealer games, I will definitely come here, but I would be happy if they would improve their slots, because now I would rather play slots somewhere else. Anyhow, I rate them with 8.",

No wagering requirements. Keep everything you win on bonuses. Money back on every single bet with ojo plus, exclusive slots tailored to their website, and an absolutely impressive line up of prizes that you can earn through prize twisters or the OJO wheel free spins games. If that isn't enough, which it should be, you can sign in to your ojo account and play the masked singer for a chance to win free prizes. What's the catch? There isn't one. Even when I don't have any money to play with I end up winning free spins or free cash on the masked singer without wagering anything! That's crazy. Nobody else in the game even does this. The kickers are what really makes this casino special also. You can expect to be rewarded on every deposit you make. I redeemed a 100 free spin kicker for a 10 dollar deposit and Ojo lets me actually keep the bonus money from those 100 spins? I love you Play OJO! You wont find a better place to play. I am giving Play OJO a 10/10 because this is the coolest online casino I have ever seen. The OJO crew verified my account in less than 24 hours which is much faster than their competitors. This is how it is done boys. I will be playing at your casino a lot more often now that I am aware of all the cool deals you can get here. It could be a little scary not knowing the processing time for your withdrawals. As it is said sometimes OJO will hold it longer. Aside from that and requiring a little patience for customer service this place is the best.",

I like this casino because it does not offer bonuses at all because the casino hate wagering in general. They do offer free spins offers and of course free spins have no wagering at all.I signed up and immediately made my first deposit and claim 50 free spins on starbust. Made my first deposit of R200 ZAR and started playing free spins. Free spins did not pay much at all and won like R30ZAR. They just added Gamomat or previously known as Edict to their selection and I always wanted to try Ramses Book because of the winner screenshots I saw in the Askgamblers forum. They had the 5-payline version and playing minimum bet of $0.25 as I would on any other slot I figured let me place the bet. The game played very well and entered the bonus feature soon. I had a mid-premium symbol in as extra scatter and got full screen of those black cats. Which landed me roughly R2015 ZAR which was almost x1000 my bet. After the feature, I stopped playing.I decided to upload my documents and my account was verified in less than 1 hour. During that hour I was waiting for verification, I wagered my deposit once then and requested a withdrawal of R2500 ZAR and voila 12 hours later the money was in my neteller account. I was very impressed and decided that this would be my better skill on net casino to play in. Support is great and withdrawals is processed quickly. What I like the most is this casino offer up to 50 wager free spins with every deposit. Free spins are added as 1 free spin for every R10/$1 equivalent. The free spins are on starbust and sometimes they have a game of the week so you can either claim the free spins that specific slot. They also have the best kicker selection and level program. You can win a spin on the wheel whenever you level up and then win some extra wager free spins.I like this casino and will always play here. Go OJO!",

My reason for the 1 star is after depositing \u00a3100 to get 25 free super spins last Monday, they quit happily took my money in seconds as usual but I never received my free spins.Contacted the last online support to be told I had deposited 3 times that day and can only claim the bonus once per day. I did and can only afford to make 1 deposit like this once in awhile I was very surprised to hear them say that, but surely they can see in my account if I had received the free spins or not??! After waiting almost an hour to talk to some one one the online chat I was then put through about 30 mins of the \u201ccopy and pasted\u201d responses that really make you feel like a special customer (looking at the time logs you can see Ojo have a policy of message at least very 2 mins to make the customer think you care. Standard rubbish like \u201cthank you for your patience, i am looking into this matter for you\u201d, 2 mins late, \u201cI am looking into this for you\u201d, 2mins later, \u201cI will be right with you\u201d, this goes on in various forms for a very very long time, then once you actually get a human (you can tell because the spelling and how unprofessional the wording then becomes).So by the time I had finished with the agent on the chat, she could see I hadn\u2019t received the free spins I should have got, she could only offer me feee spins at half the value of the initial bonus. Out of principle I kindly refused and advised that the only reason I deposited that much was due to the bonus that was being offered. I advised the agent that I will withdraw my deposit and come back another day. We wished each other farewell and I requested a withdrawal of my deposit I had down 2 hours previous and had not spent any of it because it says in their terms and conditions not to if you have a problem with a bonus to do with a deposit.Since that day Ojo keep refusing my deposit of \u00a3100 and when I send them an email or try and get in contact to ask what the reason is, there is no response at all and not a single care is given to the customer when they have a genuine issue.I work in customer sevice and what I have experienced here is that Ojo are a company very happy and quick to take your money but do not give you an ounce of respect as a customer and is impossible to get a response from them through the methods of contact they advise on their site. Loyalty counts for nothing with these guys.To sum it up, I have played weekly on Ojo for almost 2 years.I deposit \u00a3100 for the bonus attached. Didn\u2019t receive the bonus but Ojo took my \u00a3100. Online support crew couldnt give me the bonus. Didn\u2019t spend any of my deposit. Tried to withdraw my deposit. It has been refused every day now for a week with no explanation, I have tried to contact them in many ways with no luck, 5 emails sent asking why they will not let me have my money back but nothing.Funny how today I have 2 promotional emails from them trying to get me to deposit for a bonus. Good company until they are not.2 years no fuss withdrawal All of the sudden I can\u2019t withdrwa my money I just deposited and they won\u2019t tell me why. Next step, trading standards with my screen shots and bank statements. Sorry Ojo but you made me do this.Username: DaddypanikI didn\u2019t want to do this review but gave Ojo very opportunity to respond to me for over a week now and all I have had is promotional emails trying to get me to deposit more.",

My $30 nz dollars is worth only $5 nz dollars when it sits next to their welcome match bonus of $30 nz dollars arseholes ! lining their pockets with your winnings i hope they fall flat fast and hard there are many other casinos out there operating under far more acceptable fair play terms and conditions with honest RTP payouts, this casino is not one of them\u2026 dont believe me..go ahead, throw your money inthen bravely wave it goodbye !

If problems arise, customer service is just as quick to help.The VIP area is also impressive, with many exclusive activities and competitions, and there is also a bonus program.The best is saved for last, if you enjoy the services of a VIP manager, you will get to know the real advantage over other casinos.Stacey, my VIP manager, is just awesome, the regular contact, the unsolicited attention, the quick and solution-oriented problem solving of any kind and the friendliness are second to none.I cannot understand the negative reviews, I have never had such experiences at Woo and believe that these are exceptions.Be that as it may, I feel very comfortable in the Woo family and I have been playing there for several years.",

It has my favourite games too so I'm happy about that!! The customer service team are always super friendly, kind &amp; helpful!! I like the set up woo casino has as its colourful &amp; fun but not too kiddy-ish. It's not a headache to look at &amp; it's quite easy to look for anything you may need to look for. I think they have pretty good bonuses too, although I haven't picked many bonuses over my time with Woo, the bonuses I have received were generous &amp; I've also browsed through them before &amp; found them to be pretty cool. <br/>I also have a VIP manager, her name is Carly - from the moment she sent me an email to introduce herself too me, she has been very sweet, friendly &amp; generous too. She is also a very lovely person &amp; like a friend too me!! She has taken time out of her work to reply to my emails in a friendly manner &amp; not just casino related, which was very Nice to see. Carly &amp; I have kept that kind of connection ever since. Not only all that but she does a great job &amp; is always prompt, kind &amp; helpful. I like Woo casino for I have mentioned above &amp; I think it's a legit, fun &amp; super decent casino at that!! Heaps of games plus my favourite games!! Very friendly, polite and helpful customer service team\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc96 I don't have anything negative to say about woo casino that's why I've stayed with them for sooo many years.

Even tho, yeah, some casinos are having maybe a bit better cashbacks or deposit bonuses, but here is a thing the casino is so secure, so well and professional in caring, that I don't recall any little issue at all. Even when winning over 20k, all smooth, nice and professional withdrawal with seriously a matter of minutes. Any problems when soooometimes happen, there is always solution for the best outcome. Selection of games is fantastic, the deposits and withdrawals almost instant (within hour is on my account) and the best, very best part is VIP Lera! Absolutely amazing person, very, very professional, but at the same time more as a friend as well, which I find as a huge advantage.

Also, with all Direx NV casinos- bear in mind that even when playing with your own raw cash money, without any bonuses, they demand you to have wagered your own money x3 before even being able to make a withdrawal.

I have requested a full refund but of course they denied my request as it was my fault. However, after I've contacted one of ADR organisation and also sent an email to their gambling license provider, they eventually requested my bank details to issue a refund. But guess what? After 3 days of no sign of money in my bank account, I have emailed them again and their response was that it can take up to 14 business days to process the refund. Be careful with this casino, they are just robbers and liers, taking advantage of vulnerable people.",

You can see the negative reviews that many have for the \"customer service\" team at Playamo. This is the most incompetent and disrespectful customer service system I have ever encountered, in any industry. I genuinely can't believe they have anything above a 1* review. I tried and tried and tried to resolve a complaint with them, both through emails and their live chat system. I literally could not even get a response. I sent four separate emails directly to their support email address, and did not get so much as an automated reply. Nothing. I tried more than 6 times to actually talk to someone on their live support system, and after waiting and waiting and waiting, though I was #1 in the line, I would be connected to someone named \"Support Agent\" with a number *(i.e. Support Agent 2), who would give me canned, useless answers. I always asked to speak to a manager, and I made these requests at all different times and on different days. I was always, without fail, told \"sorry the manager is not available now.\" I would ask when management would be available, and I was promised that chat transcripts were recorded, but I was made to repeat my whole ordeal to every single chat person, all of whom made me go through the whole process again and again only to tell me that management was not available but that they would get back to me absolutely as soon as possible.On live chat session #5 (give or take), when the support person said, \"The manager is not available right now, sorry,\" I asked, \"So you guys just say that all the time, no matter what, huh?,\" and he did not even respond.Today, after explaining that if I did not talk to someone today (\"Support Agent\" yesterday promised me that I could speak to a manager today), I would file an official complaint, the support person finally started talking to me like an actual person, though very unprofessional. My complaint with the casino is about the wording of their terms and conditions, and this support person explicitly agreed with me that the \"rule\" in question, as written, is not binding and that the wording is confusing.In the screenshots below, you can see him agree that \"from the side of the English language [I] am right\" and \"yes, I do agree that the rules are not clear.\" He also said that he does not enforce the rules, the casino management does; he just follows the rules. But he would not allow me to talk to anyone who could do anything about this situation.So, I am down over 1 BTC and many, many, many hours of my life. The employee and spokesperson of this company agrees that the terms by which they seized my winnings is unclear and unenforceable. I gave them many, many opportunities to come to some middle ground or understanding with me, but I could not even get an email from a real person. The fact that they actually advertise as having \"friendly support\" is just laughable. If they do not resolve this with me, I am going to get a lawyer, because they cannot legally enforce their terms as written (and documented by me), a fact which is made all the more evident since the customer service person admitted it.",

I made the \"mistake\" of making a small deposit at Playamo first to test the waters, which I was told disqualified me from the welcome package, the first support agent did offer me a match bonus on my next deposit and tossed me some free spins though so I carried on undeterred. I made a few more deposits, but had no real luck. Realizing I'd now spent double the requirement for the welcome deposits 1 and 2, I figured I'd ask support if there was any way they could toss me some more free spins.. it was a short discussion..

          "comment": "Today when I saw Springbok Casino on askgamlers list of casinos I was very happy and decided to write a review about this casino and share my experience with you. Springbok uses RTG software which is a great software provider with a big choice of slot and other games but I am careful when it comes to casinos that use this software because of some bad previous experiences. The first time I played here I used a no deposit bonus of 100 rands ( rand is a volute from South Africa ) and after I met the wager requirements I had a 500 rands payout. I got the money on my Skrill account 5-6 days later after I sent the requested documents ( including a picture of me holding my ID in my hand ) and made a minimum deposit of 25 rands which is less than 2 euros. Later I had another dozen of withdrawal demands and I never had any problems. The money was always on my Skrill account after 4-5 work days. The bonus offer isn\u2019t so bad. The casino will offer a no deposit bonus and free spins and there are the standard deposit bonuses that the casino offers during the weekend. The wager demands for no deposit bonuses and free spins are 60x bonus and for deposit bonuses are 30x bonus + deposit. I must say that I am very happy with their live support which I contacted several times. Live chat is always available and friendly and if you use mail support you will get an answer no later than an hour if you sent the mail during a work day.Overall: This is one of the safest casinos when it comes to RTG software casinos. I\u2019m a big fan of RTG video poker games and their video poker games have a good payout percentage. For Springbok Casino I give a high 8 out of 10 and strongly recommend it because believe me this is one safe casino.",

          "comment": "So after much trepidation, I finally decided to try an Online Casino, and I am F***ing happy that I choose SpringbokCasino! Like any South African when I had to put my bank details to deposit I wanted out...But took the plunge and went for it, to my surprise my account hacked or taken over, my deposit was simply made. Cool, then I gambled, and with the help of Blackjack - my old friends &amp; nemesis I made R5K off R2K Deposit. This is where I thought the wheels would come off, as I then requested a withdrawal (still at that stage convinced it was a sham to get your details or something like that). So they asked for my documentation and told me 48Hrs and it would be processed - now here is my only criticism of SpringbokCasino, I understand now - that im not a total amateur - that if you request a withdrawal on almost any on-line casino expect around 10 Days wait. During which the \u201cbait\u201d to spend is laid. Now after every initial delay my paranoia grew and grew, until I essentially wrote it off\u2026 but low and behold the full R5K lands in my ACC with no BS, no \u201cProcessing Fee\u2019s and no problems. Fortunately \u2013 for my sanity \u2013 during the delayed withdrawal, the live chat support were always incredibly nice and tried their best to help, I even got 2 phone calls from America, just checking how I doing and letting me know why the processes is being delayed and that I need to just wait xxhrs. Really must give huge thanks to the live chat support guys and gals and the support that make actual phone calls, they are just too cool, and even helped me out with some heavy bonuses when I hit a big loss on the account. Yeah, springbok for life, their coupons are always regular and always something meaty, the Blackjack Perfect Pairs table never really Fu***ed me, all has been smooth and above board and I enjoy it every time I log on. If you are in SA or anywhere accepted and like me you are nervous/suspicious etc.. Just give these folks a try, I really do fell like part of their \u201cfamily\u201d they always talk about in their emails. Thanks SpringbokCasino! &amp; Thanks AskGamblers \u2013 it was only after navigating through the stack of useless online casino info/review sites that I came across AskGamblers \u2013 which is where I learned to give t 10 \u2013 14 days, only if after that there are issues withdrawing \u2013 then make plans quick!! Summary of Likes: 1) Constant Stream of Coupons - New &amp; Fun, with reasonable play-through like 99% of the time. 2) Amazing support team, live chat and the call centre, awesome people, really help if you are down on your like and make you feel more secure if your doubting validity/honesty of the withdrawal/pay-out etc. 3) No fees added to my withdrawal whatsoever, I nearly fell of my chair when I check it pop in my acc\u2026 4) Perfect Pairs Black Jack &amp; Spirit of the Inca. 5) Feels like and exclusive Club kinda, it's lekker. Summary of Dislikes: 1) Ambiguous on Withdrawal Timeline and Acc Authentication Timeline, Only as a first-timer, does it really affect you, but if they just were open I think it would make a huge difference. 2) I really want to try a netent blackjack game :P!",

I've never felt this was one of those sites that you plow money in to but get nothing back.... and there are many of those.

Unusually slow to respond, typically between 24-48 hours via chat. I have played on the site for almost 8 months and have lost every single time. Now that I have finally won a small amount of DKK 14,000. I have still after a lot of waiting NOT received my money. Good advice - stay away from this casino!",

I went to cancel a withdrawal so that I could continue playing without having to deposit ore money. I cancelled the withdrawal but couldn't play. The site told me that unless I uploaded identification documents they would stop me playing on the site. I attempted to upload the documents, but was told that the documents were either too large a file size or the incorrect format. I checked the file size of the documents and they were less than a fraction of the maximum file size being asked for. They were also all in the correct format. I have joined lots of sites where I have been able to withdraw money straight away with no hassle. The games have constant glitches which interrupt the flow of play right in the middle of a game. I do feel as though this site is not to be trusted.",

Well deposited and lost then took a 30 free bonus and met the high playthrough, sent my paperwork in and was approved. They denied my request stating that I took too many bonus without depositing . That was not the case . It states 2 free bonus between deposits. I had only taken one free when I won. I am so pissed at them for turning down my 180! (I had over 800 when they removed the extra from my account when I met playthru.) I HOPE THAT I WILL COST THEM OVER 180 IN NEW PLAYERS BECAUSE I FOLLOWED ALL THE RULES AND THEY DID SHADY WAYS!! I deserve that money. I will not deposit ever again there. I will spend the next months telling every forum I am member of, all about their shady ways! LCBers BEWARE OF THIS NOT SO FAIR GO CASINO!",

So I have deposited here probably more than anywhere else online and I have deposited ALOT.  Tens of thousands here for sure.  Anyway I been playing and verified here over 3 years with plenty of withdraws. However recently I have been on a huge losing streak not withdrawaling for months and finally I won on a free bonus after an unsuccessful deposit. Was my first bonus I used after a deposit so no violations. Met the terms and asked for a bitcoin withdrawal. I also notified them I am locked out of my primary email and gave them my new email. Well about 5 days went by and still no wmoney so I logged in to contact support and what did I see? My 180$ back in my account!? Why? So support said I needed to verify.. EXCUSE ME??? LONG STORY SHORT CUZ THIS GORS BACK N FORTH FOR 3+ WEEKS, I had to reverify everything which was ridiculous especially cuz two times I sent in the documents and one time support said they got them then the next week I checked again and support tells me they have no idea what I'm talking about they never got the documents!?!? I literally had to explain myself so many times I copy and pasted my complaints. Finally almost a month later I got paid. Oh and also out of tens of thousands in deposits I still have not made vip. So that is a joke. Still have excellent bonuses tho so I can't completely complain.  They do pay just takes forever if they don't like you which I suspect they don't like me.",

First red flag is that their software provider, RTG, provides the downloadable games, in addition to playing through your browser.  Only option available here is \"browser play.\" Most of the best paying games are NOT included. Only highly volatile games are mostly offered. Also, I have deposited 5 times here, and can easily say this casino will suck up your funds with lightning speed. I was so sad after my last deposit that I even contacted LIVE Support and offered to buy a BONUS Round on ANY slot game, because after 5 deposits I can't recall getting a BONUS round on any game, or one that paid anything significant. Just sharing my experience with my fellow slot addicts.  :-)",

So I made a withdrawal to my creditcard and it was processed instantly. Now that is a casino that understands what players want. In stead of keeping it pending hoping you recall and loose everything, they just pay out immediate. And that I why I will make another deposit today ! For me this is most important, the reliability. Further they have a nice selection of games, and a nice way to give you goodies, you can collect coins and with these coins you can buy free spins. Collection goes quite fast.

I strongly advise players to avoid Lupin Casino, as despite my loyalty and numerous deposits, they resorted to what I perceive as unfair  methods to withhold my winnings.",

Ridiculous and the service is terrible and closes the chat in the face without giving further explanation to The only explanation they give is to talk about deadlines and when the deadline is up they increase the deadline.",

I ended up playing for a few days before I verified,  which was painless,  and withdrew, on Interac which hit my bank account in 2 days. They\u2019re also not stingy with sending free spins from time to time. I would suggest that anyone in Canada give this place a try. I can\u2019t think of anything other than once you use up the welcome bonus\u2019 there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything else available besides a play $10 in one slot and get 10 free spins after, which is ok, it won\u2019t deter me from playing here again.",

Many casinos don't offer casino holdem (I'm not speaking about Texas holdem etc) so I always take the chance to play it, when I'm at a Netent or Playtech casinos. I placed 1\u20ac start bet and fortunately dealer mostly didn't qualify so I got about 20\u20ac win, within fifteen minutes. After that I visited Wolverine slot, which is one of Marvel's ",

The largest number of games coming from NetEnt software, including Net Ent Live and \"Touch\" mobile platform. Other games use as effective but less known Amatic and Yggdrasil. It is important to allow players access to quite a good combination of classic table games, card games, video poker and many types of slots. My experience is bigger when you see all my reviews, and my play on many internet casinos, and many winnings and also lost money.Besides all that we have here and the games with progressive jackpots, such as the Hall of Gods, which I tried with stakes of 5 \u20ac per spin to try to win the jackpot prize which he offers. Of course it was not realistic to expect but I can add that wonderful feeling when you know that you are moments away from earning millions but also with every spin you lose a little bit higher amounts than usual, as the 5 \u20ac per spin is not for those with low budgets. There is a famous slot machine Mega Fortune, and who holds the world record of 17.8 million euros of which the lucky winner entered history as the owner of the biggest online jackpot won.Valentine's Day is another story here because they have many generous heart when they celebrate this special day by making it more beautiful and additional free games. Last holiday here I ended with a \u20ac 150 profit, and I got the money to your account via Neteller within 48 hours. Deposits and withdrawals are possible through the following payment options including: Visa, MasterCard, Neteller, Moneybookers, iDeal, Trustly, Pugglepay, paysafecard and bank transfers. Free Spins Casino is one of the most reliable casinos in which I played and used Amatic software, from me all the praise for the Free Spins Casino.",

I met the very high wagering requirements and had a balance of $800. Knowing I could only cashout $100 I was fine with that but what really annoyed me was being told in live chat that I would have to make a deposit before I could request withdrawal. Expecting it to be what the casino's min. deposit is $25 I was shocked when told I would have to deposit $50 and wager it once then request the withdrawal of $100. When I added it all up taking into account a deposit of $50 instead of minimum deposit $25, having to wager the $50 once, either with multiple bets or one $50 bet, possible withdrawal fees and then still only be able to cashout $100 it just didn't seem worth it to me. Basically paying $50 to withdraw $100 I would only really be getting my own $50 back plus an extra $50!! If I'm going to make a deposit at any casino of $50 I would rather get no bonus or a no max cashout bonus with lower wagering requirements. I was not impressed with this and haven't gone back.

As a player that uses crypto to deposit, I appreciate the different crypto options they have for deposits/withdrawals, including LTC,BTC,BCH and BSV. As a perk for depositing/withdrawing with crypto, you are enrolled in what is called The BTC Exclusive Club. This entitles you to 15,000 (= $15) perk points and 25 free spins every week with a qualifying crypto deposit of $35 or more. More often than not, I receive my withdrawals within an hour or two. Not to mention the great deposit bonuses available. I recommend Cafe Casino to everyone who takes their playing slots seriously!  ",

The bonuses on matching deposits are always amazing and they always have great perk points program. Their live chat support is the best I've ever encountered by far.

Registering was the usual, very easy, and I liked that they use 2-step verification, where they send a code to your phone.  Their tutorials are fantastic, and there isn't a detail that isn't covered, as far as I could find.  I had some trouble opening a few of the games that I wanted to try.  This has never happened to me before, but the developers of Cafe Casino were way ahead of me.  A link at the very bottom of the page says \"browser info\".  Click on it, and you'll get a fairly detailed \"snapshot\" of the browser you're using.  I use Opera, which it didn't seem to recognize, but it was able to detect that it was a chromium browser, and that it was out of date.  Thank you, Cafe!  So now I know what I need to do as soon as I finish typing this.  Great interface, fantastic tools and information about the site, and tons of games. All that said, it's possible that this site might even be more secure than many of the others, especially due to this infrastructure and the extra built in 1-click check-up to troubleshoot your browser if necessary.",

I think it would be fair to say that i did not have a single doubt in my mind when I was thinking about creating an account on this casino. They have play tech as the game provider and have a good reputation so I knew that they would have a big software in their casino. Its been a couple of years since I played on this one. I think it was my 3rd casino that I played online. <br/><br/>I have done more than 5 withdrawals at least from this casino and had to give verification thing only for the first time and after that no questions asked I have even cashed out around 400 in one time. I started with poker here and won a lot of money playing that one. No free money or no deposit bonus as they do not need to know because such bonuses are for platforms which was not to attract users and in this case the name is enough. <br/><br/>I have played on their casino 4 times and always come out with profit. I can either thank the casino or play tech because both of them are equally good. <br/><br/>Amazingly fast support staff and quick replies to our problems but what I really liked was that they used to ask me by Emails that if I was satisfied with their service or support operator I mean such concern is just too good and puts them in a good spot. <br/><br/>Their best games are gladiator and blackjack. I played these two only most of the times. And really good variance and games are not tight. This casino is absolutely a 10 for me and their is no comparison of this casino with any other. Fast withdrawals. Good support, amazing return to players. This is the place to be for all online gamblers.",

I think that is the biggest game selection I ever seen and that is my favorite thing at this casino. They offer Playtech, BetSoft and a lot of other great games and of course you can play Poker and sportsbook and everything is on high level, everything is just great. They also offer live casino and everybody can find something interesting here no matter do you prefer table games, slots or live casino, you have all that here.I play here only with my own money without any bonuses. They don't offer any no deposit bonus for people from my country (Serbia) and I think that wagering requirements for other bonuses like welcome bonus is too high. I mean 37 times on slots is too much but that is not important because they often send me e-mail with no deposit free spins and that is very nice from them. One time I had 0 on my account and they send me 5 free spins. From that free spins I won 5 euros and later on poker I won 50 :D So that small free spins sometimes can be very very useful. Besides their great bonus system with a lot of free spins I also love their payout department. They accept all major payment option like skrill, neteller, credit card and that is normal but the best thing is that they don't have minimum withdraw limit except for neteller and for neteller is only 2 pounds. So if you use skrill ( and I do ) you can do with your money all that you want without any restriction. They are also very fast, all my payments was processed within 24 hours no matter is is working day or weekend and I love it. So I never had any problem with this casino and to be honest I don't know anybody who had problems here.  So I will give 10 stars to this casino because they deserve it. :)",

I really enjoyed this casino in the past, when play poker on professional manner and earn money from my playing. Betfair always was one of the best, they never do anything bad to me, and I passed verification only once, just upload my ID, and when I was poker player I withdrawn more than 2k$ in total, and I never wait for my money more than 24 hours, this is really great service, and this is what I can call trust, I never worried about my money, or anything related to betfair.My first deposit in this casino was in the time I was player, I just transfer money to casino, and get 100% bonus from them. I unfortunately did not win anything decent, but since that betfair casino become even better, appears more new games, and also there is always some promotions with free cash or freespins. My last deposit in this casino was in 2013, I remember that it was summer, near my birthday day, and I just deposit 50$ with 200% bonus which I was offered, to play gladiator game. I played 1$ bets around two hours, and I was glad that I am finish with 400$ on my account, most winnings comes from feature with scattered K and x 2 multiplier, where I won 300$. And like always money was paid on my skrill account without any problems or question, within 6 hours.Betfair casino is simply great, and reputable. Of course this is decent place to play, with wide selection of games, and nice support. Like I said, I never experienced problems with them, they never send me any kind of stupid spam emails, and everything on really high level of quality. I rate betfair casino with 9 stars, because I wish they add netent and microgaming games, playtech is too boring for me this days.",

The site is fast and good looking, very easy to navigate. Live chat is friendly and helpful. Had my KYC verification completed in less than an hour and first ever cashout on my Skrill in 9 minutes after requesting a withdrawal. Second one took few hours but I requested it at night so it's understandable. 3rd and so on were again processed and paid within few minutes which is always great for impatient players. Very happy with this casino. Nothing really to dislike, maybe the max cashouts on bonus offers, but I guess it's a price for having them on daily basis and sometimes even receiving 2 bonus codes on the same day ( one by email, second different offer by sms ), but it's still anywhere between 300\u20ac - 750\u20ac, so for a quick session on a low deposit it's still very attractive. Affordable way of gambling that doesn't ruin you financially and keeps you entertained.",

When my balance was at \u20ac13.75, the game went into free spins at \u20ac0.75 with the magician and 3 crystal balls, \u20ac151.50 and 10 free spins, then the game stopped. \ufeffConnection interrupted, restarted Connection interrupted, restarted again Connection interrupted but now the game no longer showed any games and the money was gone. Then I wrote to the live chat, which asked me to restart everything and delete the browser. I did everything but nothing helped, the chat kept breaking off. I wrote to 3 employees in total. The last lady then said she would forward it, it would take some time and I would receive an email. Then I received an email telling me to delete everything again. I did it, but nothing happened. Tried another browser. Nothing. Other device doesn't use anything either. A second email came. They told me they had contacted the operator and the game had run properly and no error could be found. I even included a picture so you can clearly see what I described above.\ufeffAfter I was cheated out of the money and the free spins, I asked the site to delete my account and my data because I don't want to do business with such a dubious company. They don't comply with this request either. The message comes up: I can set a limit but I don't want to do that. I want you to delete and close my account but you just don't do it.",

The design of the website is nice and you can find there a very big game collection. You can find all your favourite games there. The verification takes not much time I was verified in 24 h.  You can choose a lot of different deposit methods. Withdraws goes very quick and without any problems.What I really like on Leovegas is, they have a lot of quickspin achievements. You can get token by playing quickspin games, with this token you can buy into the bonus round of a lot of quickspin games. Leovegas offers a lot of interesting promotions. If you have an account on casino grounds forum you can join their contests from Leovegas. For example if you post a screenshot of your biggest win from the game of the contest, you have the chance to win some money and you also get some free spins for the game. For the free spins you don't need to win the contest the screenshot is enough. Leovegas have a good loyalty system. The customer support is always friendly and does their best to help you if you have any questions or problems. If you are an active player you also can ask the support for a no deposit bonus. On your birthday you get some free spins as a present even if you never have deposited yet. Leovegas is a very fair casino I trust this website. 2 times since I'm playing there they offered me a very nice promotion. I got 6 quickspin token for free. With 6 Token you can buy in 3 times to the bonus round on spinions slot. I have played on more then 100 casinos, I have never before get quickspin token for free from any of them, only at Leovegas. I can advise all of you to join this awesome casino.",

          "comment": "I signed up on LeoVegas casino around two years ago after I joined the Askgamblers forum. The Ag forum was running a meme competition and decided to join this casino so that I could take part in this competition. Leo Vegas casino has a very simple design and the sign-up process takes around 30 seconds. Since the casino is geo targeted you can only play in your local currency and for me its INR. The casino has various payment option for players from India and these options include Skrill, Neteller, Ecopayz, Muchbetter, Jeton, Visa, Astropay and also bank deposits. Most of these methods can be used for withdrawals also. The minimum amount for Deposit depends on your payment option and its between INR800-INR1000. The casino has a slot section with almost 2500 games and the slots are provided by some big industry names like Play\u2019nGo, Relax, Elk, Blueprint gaming, red tiger, Isoftbet, Netent, Pragmatic play and many more. They also have a live casino section that includes various table and card games. The casino also has a dedicated sports section where you can place bets on more than 40 sports and esports events. The casino has a welcome package of INR80000 which can be claimed across 3 deposits. The bonus needs to me claimed 30 times using real money before it can be turned into real money. You can make more than one deposit to clear wager and I think it really helps player who miss out on bonuses with a small margin. The casino also has a sports welcome offer of INR10000 with similar terms. One important thing about the bonuses is that you need to claim your bonus offer in under 14 days of signing up at the casino. The casino has a great support staff and they are available via email and live chat 24x7. The verification process takes under 24 hours. So far, I have made around 6 deposits at the casino and managed to cash out 4 times plus I won two contests. I have always managed to receive my withdrawal in under 10 minutes of placing request. The good thing about the casino is that they treat all their players like VIP and if you go on chat and ask them to push your withdrawal they oblige. It\u2019s a great casino with great slots, bonus offers, player friendly terms so you should definitely try them.",

I've been waiting for an answer from Leovegas for 6 weeks about where my money went. But there they don't think it's necessary to react at all. This is scandalous and I will be filing criminal charges. We're not talking about 10 euros here, but about 200 euros. I had to pay almost 40 euros just for tracking through my bank.

          "comment": "Almost nothing I liked about this casino. \n\nNever go for the bonuses it's almost not even your worthwhile. It's in fact a lot more stricter and protective of casino fund than any other casino that I've ever seen. Not only you have betting limits when you get a bonus but some games such as the famous progressive jackpot game Mega Moola gets locked out so when you try to play it says play with your own funds and not the bonus funds. Which is so extremely annoying. \n\nThe games aren't categorically organized (e.g. Video Poker, Table Games, Slots, etc) like in most online casinos and they're all clustered together which makes it very annoying to figure out what game is which and you have to guess half the time. Very poor selection of games and extremely boring too. I never got into the most of the slot games except Mega Moolah which got locked out after a while since I was playing with bonus money, and prompted me to put in my own cash to play it. \n\nSo finally switched over to blackjack where most casinos have at least have 6-9 different sorts of black jack this one only had two multihand and single deck blackjack games were at least one had really poor graphics and only few handful randomly numbered chips were it was hard to get the desired exact bets even by combining them. At the end I think I ended up playing with the multhand black jack just for the sake of playing something. Luck was extremely bad at first almost lost all the 5 out of 6 bets which is a bit unlikely in real life casino, eventually by playing careful made a slight profit, but eventually lost everything when I got too ambitious. The point being thou during the gameplay I perceived a lot of unusual play patterns from the dealer where it kept pulling off few black jacks in a row or even pulling off a 21 when the dealer had 5 or 6 where in reality those are known to be potential bust cards. It would be so frustrating for me because I would have a 20 at hand and thinking that I had it, and then to my awe the dealer pulls off a 21 on a 5 or a 6. Either way I am highly suspicious that most games are rigged highly aimed at ensuring casinos consistent profit and minimal loss. Play here at your own risk. I give a very low rating for all the given reasons above.",

Very small or no bonuses such as 3-5 free spins on a slot, I dont' know why they would bother. I have noticed a few players with the same problem I have had before with LeoVegas, being that there seems to be an error in their system with the amounts won.The whole time playing this casino felt as though someone was taking my winnings and using it elsewhere. When I checked my game history there were games there that I hadn't even played before.When I asked the very unfriendly staff about the error, she informed me to delete my cookies and check again and it would be right, and there were no winnings outstanding from my play.This wasn't the first time I had noticed my winnings not going into my account, rather just disappearing as though it was being played elsewhere. The Customer Service woman was rude to me last time and I had spoken to her before and remember her being very similarly unhelpful, as though she was busy and had better things to do with her time. She wasn't interested in the problem I was having and made me feel stupid as though I had just imagined it, and also interrupted her time. I received no compensation for this and no message or follow up from management when I had submitted a bad review on the chat conversation.I have not made a deposit into LeoVegas since this day. And I'm hesitant to do so again. As for the rudeness of the staff member, if a staff member treated my clients that way, I would not be happy, and I most definitely would at least remove them from that role, without the attitude and ignorance of this woman, I would have probably been back but I feel threatened by this woman as she has access to my gaming and personal information, all the more reason for a friendly customer service approach and the importance of ensuring trust by customers which is what we are, donating money to someone that awful is not my idea of good fun.",

I can't play at Fly Casino anymore, due to the recent accessibility blockage by the local Authorities and ISP, but I certainly must carry on with my review!I accidentally came across this casino whilst browsing a Playtech list somewhere, and to my surprise, it mentioned that Fly Casino was a newly launched sister casino to Omni, my number 1 favourite casino at that time. Without wasting much time, I then visited their website, saw their good welcoming package offer, and signed up immediately, without any hesitation at all. A decision I have never ever regretted since!What goes for Omni Casino, goes for Fly too, in terms of its Terms &amp; Conditions, Bonus Terms, wagering requirements, and so forth. Being a different brand from Omni, their regular bonus offers differ too, albeit marginally. Almost every day of the week, there's always something special to go for. Big and small bonuses, Hot Seat Promotion points, plus some 'specials' for table players too. From day 1 of joining, I tried never to miss out on any of these offers. They were simply too good to miss!My beginning with Fly Casino was simply unbelievable! By the time I made my third deposit, I broke the casino's house with a marvelous huge win from playing the game Dolphin Reef. Needless to say, Dolphin Reef was my number 1 favorite game at that time, for most of the time in fact, until overtaken by Mr Cashback. From that $3500 first withdrawal, I never looked back, from then right up to now. Fly Casino was, and still is, the only casino I have never gone into the red after 2 initial small deposits! My climb to the Gold VIP level was a very quick one. I would be playing almost every day of the week, whenever there was a bonus to be taken. Usually, every Wednesdays would not have any promotion, I don't know why, but I would take up a third bonus offer every Tuesday and reserve it for Wednesday play. So everyday was a play day for me! After about 1 year of playing at Fly Casino, I had overtaken Omni in my total accumulated Comp Points! These points were finally converted into real cash, with no wagering attached.Withdrawals time frame are second only to Omni Casino, within just 2 days. If I had made to Platinum VIP Level, as at Omni, I guess my payments would be in within 1 day too. Well, it is all over by now. I can no longer access any of these casinos, and my wonderful times at both Omni and Fly finally comes to an end, rather reluctantly I must say! These are the best two I have ever come across, where Playtech is concerned.",

Both Playtech casinos, and I love to play at fly casino, because they are very generous in terms of bonuses, and always give a lot of reload bonuses, plus other promotions.I love customer support at fly casino. Couple of times I wanted to play in their casino, but I did not liked bonus which they offer this day, so I just pop up in chat and ask them if this possible to get something else, probably something better. And they always helped me with it, and I never had any trouble with getting reload bonus higher than usual. So if you want something extra it will not hurt you to try to speak with their live chat, they not only very friendly, but also they usually moving things in your turn. Huge thumbs up for that, I love when things like that happens.Bonuses and promotions are probably best in comparing with all other Playtech casinos. Except sister Omni casino of course. Almost every day there is special promotion, and usually it is reload bonus. It is just great to have so much bonuses, cashbacks, some raffles and website, and it really makes me usually deposit in this casino, not any other Playtech place. Few times they had big tournaments, but probably it was not successful because Omni casino for sure has much more tournaments on regular basis.Withdrawals is great. I had only two payouts from this casino, and first big thumbs up because they did not asked my documents at all. Two payouts was processed probably under 24 hours time, and it is faster than many other casinos with this software, and it is just thumbs up for me, getting paid within 24 hours and without request to verify account is just awesome service by casino, and I did not have any complaints about it.I rate this casino with 9 stars, great place to enjoy Playtech games. Most bonuses is not cashable, and this is why I did not give this casino 10 stars.",

The jackpots can get really big and my favorite is probably the incredible hulk slot but I am really just a fan of them all. Aside from the slots, this site also has a great selection of games in general. They\u2019ve got video poker, table games and much more at your fingertips.

It operates the DigimediaLtd group this operates few another quiteknown online casinos, its reputable as well. These games are single and one-software so there is no game variety at all, and the bonus is also quite poor.\nWelcome bonus\nPoorPoorPoor and a bit more Poor! 100% bonus is convention,nothing special.Sad - my opinion, really nothing other than this bonus! Joking or kidding all the customers. Weird as hell.\nDeposits and withdrawals\nThere is a bunch of various deposit or withdrawal methods, my Skrill deposit of 25 was raised to unusual 50$ ! THAT SURPRISE!\nNor withdrawal appeared to me this time (again)! Nothing positive since I began this Review. This is really sad.\nCustomer support\nLive chat support is providing here as well - live support help is 24/7, I rate the service good but nowadays this is a standard already.\nGameplay\nI played two older games on lower stakes only.\nAvalon 0.20-1.80/spin\nThunderstruck 0.09-0.45/spin \nSummary\nI don\u2019t recommend this River Belle online casino because nothing there is worth your time or money. \ud83d\ude42\n\u2003 ",

One of the best looking playtech casino's official site, with amazing layout and combined green/black, can not leave You indifferent. Instand or download, even mobile - all okay with Casino tropez. Operating for over 10 years, casino has reliable reputation and ove 400 popular playtech games with huge jackpots as well. nice support team, could be reached over the phone, email or live chat. Responses quick and good Quality if You got any questions. The only thing that I dont like too much - long pending withdrawal time. 4 days are too long time to wait. Ilike to get money in maximum 48 hours. But they do exceptions for Highrollers and VIP players. All in all - great and reputable casino with amazing playtech games!",

This casino is available on flash play, so I didn't have to download anything, I signed up and made a 30\u20ac deposit. I started with Casino Holdem. I placed 1\u20ac bets, but playing it for some time it only gave me loss, so I went directly to Iron Man 3. I played it with 0.50\u20ac bets per spin but somehow this game wasn't lucky for me at all, so with 10\u20ac left in my account I went to Iron Man 2, I guess I like the look of it better. I placed the same value bets and finally, after few empty spins I hit free spins features and my 10 free spins gave me 15\u20ac win. I continued, increasing my bets to 1\u20ac per spin and many wins like 2.40 came up very often and I got free spins again. Overall, after spending there more than an hour, I quit this game with 70\u20ac! I was very happy with it, since I'm usually luckier in table games.After that I visited Spiderman. I placed 0.50\u20ac bets and within first 10 spins I got Spiderman bonus. I was pretty excited because I haven't got this bonus before and it gave me 10 free Spiderman Rivaling games. The spins started but then the spider man feature came and put a net (freezed) the amount of free spins, so I got a lot more than only 10 free spins. But when the Goblin came and broke the net and the free spins ended, I got a 47\u20ac win from this bonus! Amazing! After that I visited few more marvel jackpots, but luck like this didn't appear again. Then I made a successful withdrawal.I have to say that I'm super happy with my experience at Casino Tropez. I didn't meet any kind of problems.The withdrawal took about 3 days, so I do recommend this casino and I will surely go back there!",

Where alot of casinos have max cashout amounts. They also have fantastic deposit bonuses where u can get up to 200% bonus. Sometimes their casino reps call aswell and if u make a deposit while they're on the phone they give you an additional bonus on top of your deposit bonus. The only thing is that you have more wagering to do obviously but I LOVE EXTRA FREE BONUSES \ud83d\ude42 they are also very generous with giving out free no deposit bonuses especially if you deposit regularly. My favorite games or should I say GAME is Fantastic Four 20 line marvel game. I'm terrible though because I hate changing games once I love a game. I just love it! They have an awesome free games feature where you can earn nice money:). The chat support is also very efficient and friendly. ",

Yeah, if i see new casino and it is not in rogue list anywhere, i will definitely give it a go! Thats happens with casino tropez, i found their offer of 1000 freespins plus a nice 100% bonus. Of course i decide to play this 1000 freespins and you know what i get? \ud83d\ude42 Hehe, its 10$ bonus instead of 1000 freespins, because 10$ it is 1000 freespins on any slot playing at min bet one line. 1 penny bets, really, they call it freespin? Probably the biggest laugh i had after promotion from this casino... I never win in this casino, and i am happy with that, because if i will judge them by this promo, it is totally missleading and unacceptable for me. Support: Talked with live chat, after every sentences their try to offer you bonus on deposit. Really? Withdrawals: Did not test (thank you God). Software: No problems with software. Casino tropez get 2 stars, they even worse than most playtech casinos. I did not recommend to anyone play in this casino, there are a lot of better playtech casinos which will not made idiotic promotions. ",

This casino has the worst support ever and this is one of the main reasons i stopped playing here. I am not sure if this has been corrected as i stopped playing here for over 6 months now and will not play here again or entertain their rude support team. I would suggest not playing here.",

Bitcoin payouts are consistent.  If it takes 5 days, it takes 5 days, and will always take 5 days.  That's not been my experience, tho.  Never more than 3 days to receive a payout, whether it be $300 or $2000.  The bread and butter of GTBets is their sportsbook which is rated in the Top 10 in nearly every important monitoring site.  Because their sportsbook is super effective, that, of course, carries over to the casino.  This spot pays off, and their business practices are extremely consistent.  BetonSoft is just tight anyway, but you can trust your money with these guys and you can count on anything they say they're gonna do, they'll do it...absolutely on key everytime.

Unlike some books that make withdrawal a risk. GT was right on top of my withdrawal. I also like that they have same freeroll tournaments as Gossip Slots and Drake casino. No problems with customer service. And they offer occasional free wagers (recently a 5 dollar freebie on the Kentucky Derby. Another unique perk when you sign up you get to pick your favorite teams in pro football, pro basketball, college football and college basketball, each time you wager on one of your favorite teams you get a free half a point. That half point may not sound like much but in the game of sports betting it can potentially be a HUGE advantage.Oh and you get to pick not just one favorite team but 2 in each of the afore mentioned.",

Or lack there of?\" and \"How to cheat your players and justify it! The GTBets Way!\" (In all fairness, this happens to also be the motto of drake and gossipslots, but I'm about 99.9% positive it's the same customer service team that services all three sites.)<br>This was a fascinating week for me whilst dealing with these sites customer service departments.  It started with gossipslots, where I made a deposit and was waiting for my lcb shop purchase of some free spins, which I thought I received and turned out to have been some random deposit bonus. I played them, realized they weren't my shop purchase and neither accepted or denied the bonus of a whomping $2, to which I then had a rollover applied to of something along the lines of 80x (a fairly common sizing for gossip and drake). I contacted customer service to let them know I did not want this bonus, and that I was mistaken in thinking those spins were my ones from LCB. They told me, in different words, too bad. As per usual, they ascribed to the policy of \"we don't really care about you, we just want your money, and we're going to make it as difficult as possible for you to get it back...BUT we know you'll keep coming back, because we understand the mind of the gambler...)

I just love that how effectively this site has been designed and the site is very fast and responsive as well. The amazing looking sit keeps us hooked all the time and stops the games from being monotonous. It's very important for the games to be entertaining because when the games are slow and boring player is not very interested in playing and loses his focus and money both. It is good for the casino but that is not gonna at any room sustain for long and this is the best thing about royal panda casino that they keep us hooked with the animations and the bonus all the time and I love simply love it. They have a very wide variety of games to offer to its uses and the variance on this casino room is very good. They have a good bonus for the new users as well. I honestly did not win a lot of money with them but did not lose as well. Something is better than nothing. I was having a hard time playing video poker but then I contacted the support team and they helped me very efficiently. They support all the deposit modes and the transaction process is also very swift and took no time while depositing or withdrawing, This site is regularised under Malta so there is no point of scam or any fraudulent activities. I even referred this casino room to a couple of friends of mine. and benefited from that as well because the referral process is very nice and i know that my friends are also very happy with this casino room as they are also earning good money with them.",

The earlier opening time is very convenient for me because I live in Australia and 3pm is when I finish work and that is when i like to sit back and play my slots so i now no longer have to wait till 7pm to get any assistance if I need it.I was even more surprised when I read that the casino was offering my 10 free spins on twin spin for the inconvenience caused!I am already a big fan of this casino but now I am an bigger fan because no other casino has ever read any of my reviews and actually gone and done something about it. Royal panda hasn't been open for long so I don't expect them to have 24/7 live support and now that they have decided to increase the live chat hours I have nothing but praise for this casino.There are some casinos that are open 24/7 yet they might as well not be because their staff are not well informed about latest promos/bonuses  and/or cant manually credit bonuses etc. Everytime that I have used live chat at royal panda they have been able to resolve my issues without me having to email support and wait for a reply. If live chat cant resolve my problem they tell me to wait online while they speak to someone that can help and my problem is then fixed. I hope that other casinos follow suite and do wot royal panda have done which is listen to their players and improve where in the areas needed.This casino can and will only get better because they are making all the right moves .",

          "comment": "Earlier this year I signed up in \u201cRoyal Panda\u201d casino mainly because I read many good comments about it on different websites and forums, and then I wanted to explore it a little deeper because you need to log in to access some games and also because I always like to see all options available in the users\u2019 area.First, I think its portfolio of games is robust enough, there you can choose between slots, table games, video poker and others, all them developed by prestigious companies such as Microgaming, NetEnt, NYX Interactive, Elk Studios, NextGen, and others. Also, if you like to play live dealer games, here you will find all the games offered by Evolution Gaming which is one of the leading companies in this specific niche in the gambling industry.Another aspect I really liked here is that their terms and conditions, including the bonus terms, are sufficiently clear, in fact, I have never had the need to contact support team to ask for an explanation about this and nor for other reasons since I've never had any trouble playing on this casino.Within the user's area I could find all the options usually available at the best casinos, including bet history, which is very important for me because it allows me to check everything about each of my bets, and the truth is that this information is not available in many other casinos, so I wanted to highlight this aspect here.The first time I played at Royal Panda it was thanks to 10 free spins I received in my email to be played in Pyramid: Quest for Immortality slot, they were 10 free spins that left me more than $35 of profit that later I would make them rise up to more than $300 mainly thanks to Thunderfist and Flowers slots and also live baccarat; then my bonus was ruined because in a moment of inattention I violated the term about maximum bet of $7.50 when I held some reels playing Hot Ink slot by paying in total more than that amount, situation that I could check myself in my bet history records.After that, I made a couple of deposits at this casino but my luck was not so good as that first day; anyway, I can see that the good reputation of Royal Panda consolidates more each passing day and certainly this will be a casino that will receive many other deposits from me since I feel supremely comfortable playing on it.",

So, when you will claim a bonus, loosing real money and continuing playing with the bonus funds and win: You won't be able to withdraw your winnings, because you can't finish the wagering requirements. You have to make deposits again and again, until wagering is completed. This is highly increasing the risk of loosing your winnings made with bonus. So, it's easier to play with your own funds without claiming a bonus. This is kind of cheating and unserious offer!",

This is completely a scam casino, I tried to withdraw my 2000 cad and they asked for a lot of document. Event after providing all documents they asked for proof of ownership of bank card from bank and they declined a document provided by my bank with bank stamp and current date.

It literally says has an average rating of 2.7 stars and I know there are higher rates casinos on here. I played my $35 deposited in less then to minutes and I was playing conservatively. The outdated layout and the color scheme of this casino leaves something to be desired. Whoever told them that baby poop colors were the thing needs to be fired. I would have had trouble continuing to play hear just because of that to be honest. It is not visually pleasing at all. There is no license for this casino either and a high minimum withdrawal with very limited deposit options. Again I find myself scratching my head as to how this is number one when it should be at the bottom in my opinion. All in all there are far better RTG casinos out there. Go elsewhere ",

This is the most incompetent and disrespectful customer service system I have ever encountered, in any industry. I genuinely can't believe they have anything above a 1* review. I tried and tried and tried to resolve a complaint with them, both through emails and their live chat system. I literally could not even get a response. I sent four separate emails directly to their support email address, and did not get so much as an automated reply. Nothing. I tried more than 6 times to actually talk to someone on their live support system, and after waiting and waiting and waiting, though I was #1 in the line, I would be connected to someone named &quot;Support Agent&quot; with a number *(i.e. Support Agent 2), who would give me canned, useless answers. I always asked to speak to a manager, and I made these requests at all different times and on different days. I was always, without fail, told &quot;sorry the manager is not available now.&quot; I would ask when management would be available, and I was promised that chat transcripts were recorded, but I was made to repeat my whole ordeal to every single chat person, all of whom made me go through the whole process again and again only to tell me that management was not available but that they would get back to me absolutely as soon as possible.On live chat session #5 (give or take), when the support person said, &quot;The manager is not available right now, sorry,&quot; I asked, &quot;So you guys just say that all the time, no matter what, huh?,&quot; and he did not even respond.Today, after explaining that if I did not talk to someone today (&quot;Support Agent&quot; yesterday promised me that I could speak to a manager today), I would file an official complaint, the support person finally started talking to me like an actual person, though very unprofessional. My complaint with the casino is about the wording of their terms and conditions, and this support person explicitly agreed with me that the &quot;rule&quot; in question, as written, is not binding and that the wording is confusing.In the screenshots below, you can see him agree that &quot;from the side of the English language [I] am right&quot; and &quot;yes, I do agree that the rules are not clear.&quot; He also said that he does not enforce the rules, the casino management does; he just follows the rules. But he would not allow me to talk to anyone who could do anything about this situation.So, I am down over 1 BTC and many, many, many hours of my life. The employee and spokesperson of this company agrees that the terms by which they seized my winnings is unclear and unenforceable. I gave them many, many opportunities to come to some middle ground or understanding with me, but I could not even get an email from a real person. The fact that they actually advertise as having &quot;friendly support&quot; is just laughable. If they do not resolve this with me, I am going to get a lawyer, because they cannot legally enforce their terms as written (and documented by me), a fact which is made all the more evident since the customer service person admitted it.",

This is a licensed casino, gamblers have many options to play whatever they want. You can use cryptocurrency and get it transferred without commission. I find this way the most convenient. I have never tried using real money here, so can't tell you anything about it. There is a decent bonus program here, you get some free spins and a 100% on your first deposit, but there are some rules on money transfer after you get them. I like playing here you can get a solid profit. Imho the slots are fair, total random, I\u2019ve never had a feeling that they try to steal my money. I\u2019ve won numerous times. The site is convenient, it\u2019s easy to choose a game, you can sort games by the developer or by the name, each game has its own description and rules. The dealers are not bots, card games work well and don\u2019t freeze after placing a bet. I played Keno and Roll the dice, I like them, you can have a great time playing these games and win some money.",

Second problem it that live chat can not help in financial matters, you have to push the kyc to have an answer when you get your next chunk of withdrawal. Answer takes 3 DAYS. I had no option, I played away rest of my winnings..... they did not let me other solution....... I do not recommend to play there anyway.

I had some issues and they just told me to come back later that day or the next day and they would fix the problem. I came back and again I just got the same response.

This site has a serious problem with it's internal communication and there seem to me no notes, reference number or something else in order to give custumer support any form of insign into a problem.

I usually play slots once a month, especially taking advantage of the Friday bonuses. And believe it or not, I have been incredibly lucky! I always end up winning. The most impressive thing is the process of withdrawing funds. I've already made dozens of withdrawals, and I'm surprised by how fast they are. Payments are processed within seconds, which is simply unbelievable. I have never seen a casino so efficient in this aspect. So far, my experience has been absolutely perfect.

Everything is good until you have to deal with support.I made a deposit that was taken from my account, and not deposited into my bodog account. I then contacted support and they would look into it. The following day I tried to deposit again, same thing, taken from my bank and not credited to my account. I have contacted support multiple times, explained everything very clear, sent them a screenshots of my bank statement proving the money came out of my account. It has now been 4 days and still nothing, most I have got from support is they are investigating the situtation. For me 4 days is to much, I have done all I can to prove it. And the lack of communication from support is frustrating. You would think since I have been a customer for 8 years and gamble on a daily basis, they would try to keep me happy. But no they don't care, lots of other gamblers or there, so why should they try to keep me happy. I am now being forced to contact RBC and dispute that charges ad fraud. Thanks bodog. I even told them why don't they just credit the deposits to my bodog account but block all withdraws until then confirm what I am saying is true, but no, they didn't even respond to that. Then I started receiving emails saying that I had called into support and the matter had been solved, when I have not called their support I only emailed them and it was never solved, last thing they told me was it will tasked 1-2 businrss days to sort out. 4 days later I am writing this review, calling my bank to dispute the charges and about to sign up to sports interaction. Other then this I've only had one issue in the past with bodog, one time I deposited with bitcoin and it took them 5 days to credit into to my account. <br/><br/>That is all, I wouldn't tell people not to use bodog but I would just warn them of what happened to me and what could happen to them, and that their is probably better sites that won't have all this bullshit I dealt with.When your a daily gambler and they mess with your deposit for 4 days can got very frustrating, I shouldn't have to threaten them with contacting my bank but when they don't give any updates or tell me I phoned in and the case is solved, then they sort of force me to.",

They offer free tournaments Saturday - Wednesday with a start balance of $100.00 and when you purchase a re-buy for $1.00, it's doubles to $200.00 plus your balance remaining of $5.00 or less. (Other casino offer free-tournaments too, with 1st, 2nd and 3rd money positions only, you have to pay a ridiculous amount of money to continue with the game and a lesser amount to continue with than you started with FREE.) Drake and Gossip (sister) lists thirteen (13) money spots 6-13 wins $5.00. That's so cool! Their selection of slots, poker, keno, scratchier and more is Hugh and fun to bounce around in. Then they have a Twitter Free-roll tournament with an entry free of $2.00. But it's free if you follow Drake on Twitter. A code is posted on Thursday, redeem it at the Cashiers, you're registered with game start on Friday. They also have tournaments with entry fees weekenders, poker and the like. Another thing, there's not been a time that I can remember when I've posted a comment on Twitter to Drake and they've not responded in kind. Drake is a place where YOU matter! I've never been treated like a stranger or guest. It's personable, friendly and fun and they're assist you where ever they can. Hope you give them a try, especially if you enjoy tournaments.

Upon it sitting for a few weeks, and waiting for their wu/mg option to become active again, I contacted chat a few times, and asked when they would be activating the option again, they replied that it was indefinite. So I forgot about it for another few weeks, then logged in to check options and contact support about it. They gave me the email for payouts, and suggested I ask them if they would make an exception. I did so, and surprisingly they responded that they would send via mg with a 50 dollar fee attached to it. I received my payout 2 days later. Bravo!!!!!! Well Done!",

I signed up over the weekend , and got lucky , hit a jackpot and went well over my rollover required at signup to get the bonus ( rollover was 17k ) ... i requested a whithdraw and today they said it cant be processed and they actually took away my money , they just gave me $200 because thats what my balance was before i broke the rule they said , the rule ? betting more than $25, which i did on live casino after i met the rollover requirments ... i asked to speak to a supervisor but they wouldn't transfer and kept saying i broke the rule and they wouldnt send me the timestamp about it . now they removed my money and just gave me $200 bonus . Plain and simple , when you win they won't pay you . They will find any way not to . SCAM !!!",

Except they don't care about the casino all you do is lose. You can't bet above a dollar cause then you really lose at a faster rate. I asked for a free chip or some cashback and they do not give that at all. All they could say is sorry for the inconvenience. I should have done my research before I lost so much money. They are not licensed by a reputable company. That tells the whole story. Deposit here on the slots and you will lose. Player beware! There is absolutely no return to player. Terrible place to play.",
